Looms are very cool, and weaving involves a decent amount of arithmetic.  Many fiber arts do.  

I recently acquired an AVL warping wheel to use with my 8-shaft Gilmore jack loom, which happened to have a sectional back beam upgrade installed when I purchased it.  My first project with the warping wheel was very stripy warp, and I found that I was having a hard time calculating ideal section size on the fly, ie, while winding the warp.  

For sectional warping, each section has to be equal to or slightly wider than the width of the sections on your back beam.  And if you have a stripy warp, the color changes very likely will not line up nicely with sections.  And additionally, you will very likely not have an equally divisible number of warp strands per section.  

So this very simple script calculates that for us. Of course, it needs many more features to be useful to everyone, but I have been finding it very useful.
